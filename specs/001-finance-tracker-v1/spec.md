# Feature Specification: Financial Copilot v1 — Personal Finance Tracker

**Feature Branch**: `001-finance-tracker-v1`

**Created**: 2026-09-25

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "We are building a personal finance tracker", plus a v1 features
document defining five capabilities (accounts, transactions, categories, budgets, insights) and an
explicit out-of-scope list. That document is folded into this spec in full; this spec is the single
source for what v1 contains. Nothing here is optional; nothing not here is in v1.

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-09-25

- Q: Which account does manual entry default to when the user has no cash account? → A: One
  always exists: the app ships with a predefined "Cash" account, and manual entry defaults to it.
  If it no longer exists, default to the account most recently used for manual entry.
- Q: When the Insights period spans several calendar months, how is budget progress shown? → A:
  For the most recent calendar month in the period only.
- Q: Which view does the app open on? → A: The transaction list, for now; may change later.
- Q: When a bank file has no counterparty column, how does review decide two rows share a vendor?
  → A: In v1 it does not: rows are grouped only by a mapped counterparty column and are otherwise
  ungrouped. Deriving a vendor from the description is deferred ([Out of Scope](#out-of-scope)).
- Q: Can an expense or income be saved without a category? → A: No, and the UI never offers that
  state: the category holds the side's "Uncategorised" until the user picks another.
- Q: Can a transfer be given a category? → A: No; when the kind is transfer, the form shows a
  destination account in place of the category.
- Q: What does the manual-entry form hold when opened, and can it be saved as is? → A: Kind
  expense, date today, amount 0.00, account "Cash", category expense "Uncategorised", description
  empty. Saving unchanged books a 0.00 expense with no description to "Cash". Description is
  optional; a zero amount is allowed.
- Q: How is an opening balance changed? → A: Only after a severe warning that the user confirms.
- Q: Is reconciliation a way to enter a balance? → A: Yes; the user states the actual balance and
  the app books the difference as a transaction. What is forbidden is storing or editing the
  balance as a number of its own.
- Q: Is a row a duplicate when only its description differs? → A: Yes; duplicates match on
  account, date, and amount only.
- Q: How are unparsable and duplicate rows shown in review? → A: Low-prominence: they are kept out
  of the rows under review, review shows a count for each, and selecting the count presents them.
- Q: Can an imported row be confirmed without a category? → A: No; every row's category dropdown
  holds the side's "Uncategorised" until the user picks another.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Keep a trustworthy ledger by hand (Priority: P1)

The user creates the accounts they want to track, each with the balance it held on the day tracking
began, and records expenses, income, and transfers between their own accounts. Every account shows
a balance computed from its opening balance and its transactions. Manual entry is fast enough to use
for every cash purchase.

**Why this priority**: Every other capability reads from this ledger. Without accounts and
transactions there is nothing to import into, categorise, budget, or chart. A user with only this
story has a usable cash book.

**Independent Test**: Create two accounts, record an expense, an income, and a transfer, and confirm
both balances equal opening balance plus the net of their transactions. Delivers a working ledger.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh install, **When** the user opens the account list, **Then** it contains exactly
   one account, the predefined "Cash", with balance 0.00.
2. **Given** only the predefined "Cash" account, **When** the user creates account "Checking" of
   type checking with opening balance 1,250.00, **Then** the account list shows "Checking" with
   balance 1,250.00.
3. **Given** "Checking" with balance 1,250.00, **When** the user records an expense of 40.00 dated
   2026-09-03, description "Weekly shop", category "Groceries", **Then** "Checking" shows 1,210.00.
4. **Given** "Checking" (1,210.00) and "Cash" (0.00), **When** the user records a transfer of 100.00
   from "Checking" to "Cash", **Then** "Checking" shows 1,110.00, "Cash" shows 100.00, and total
   spending and total income are unchanged.
5. **Given** the user is recording an expense, **When** the category picker opens, **Then** it offers
   expense categories only, and exactly one entry named "Uncategorised", and exactly one category named "Unaccounted".
6. **Given** the user is recording an expense or an income, **When** they look for a way to leave
   the category empty, **Then** none exists: the category holds the side's "Uncategorised" until
   they pick another.
7. **Given** the user sets the kind to transfer, **Then** the form offers a destination account in
   place of the category, and the destination picker does not offer the source account.
8. **Given** the predefined "Cash" account still exists, **When** the user opens manual entry,
   **Then** the kind is expense, the date is today, the amount is 0.00, the account is "Cash", the
   category is expense "Uncategorised", and the description is empty; **When** the user saves
   without changing anything, **Then** an expense of 0.00 with no description is booked to "Cash"
   in "Uncategorised".
9. **Given** the user's last manual entry was recorded to "Checking", **When** they open manual
   entry again, **Then** the account is still "Cash".
10. **Given** "Checking" has an opening balance of 1,250.00, **When** the user changes the opening
    balance to 1,300.00, **Then** the app shows a severe warning that every
    balance this account has ever shown will change and asks for confirmation; **When** the user
    confirms, **Then** the computed balance rises by 50.00 and no transaction is created.
11. **Given** any account, **When** the user looks for a way to type in a balance directly, **Then**
    none exists; the only ways to change a balance are transactions, the opening balance, and
    reconciliation ([User Story 5](#user-story-5)).

---

### User Story 2 - Import a bank CSV and review it by vendor (Priority: P2)

The user downloads a CSV export from their bank, tells the app once how that bank's file is laid
out, and imports it. Parsed rows wait in a pending batch outside the ledger. The user reviews the
batch grouped by vendor, assigns categories a group at a time, marks own-account payments as
transfers, and confirms. Re-importing an overlapping date range adds nothing twice.

**Why this priority**: CSV import is the primary path for everything the bank sees and the
highest-risk feature in the product. It is P2 only because the ledger it feeds must exist first.

**Independent Test**: Import a real bank export with a new mapping profile, review and confirm it,
then import the following month's file with the same profile and a deliberately overlapping range.
Delivers bank data in the ledger with no duplicates and a saved profile.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a CSV whose columns are in an order the app has never seen, **When** the user assigns
   the date, amount, and description columns, chooses the date format, decimal separator, and file
   encoding, and saves this as profile "MyBank", **Then** the file parses into a pending batch and
   no balance or figure in the app changes.
2. **Given** profile "MyBank" exists, **When** the user imports next month's file from the same
   bank, **Then** the profile is applied without any re-mapping.
3. **Given** a bank whose export uses separate debit and credit columns, **When** the user maps both
   in the profile, **Then** debit rows become expenses and credit rows become incomes.
4. **Given** a pending batch of 300 rows from 40 vendors, from a file whose profile maps a
   counterparty column, **When** the user opens review, **Then** each vendor with more than one row
   is shown as one group, vendors with a single row are shown as plain rows, and assigning a
   category to a group assigns it to every row in the group.
5. **Given** a vendor group whose rows belong in different categories, **When** the user unfolds the
   group, **Then** each row can be given its own category without affecting the others.
6. **Given** a file whose profile maps no counterparty column, **When** the user opens review,
   **Then** the rows are presented ungrouped, each with its own category dropdown.
7. **Given** a row that is a payment to the user's own credit card account, **When** the user marks
   it as a transfer to that account, **Then** on confirmation it enters the ledger as a transfer
   with no category and is excluded from spending.
8. **Given** a batch contains rows matching transactions already in the ledger on account, date,
   and amount but with different descriptions, **When** the user opens review, **Then** those rows
   are not among the rows under review, a count of duplicates is shown, selecting the count
   presents them, and the user can include any single one.
9. **Given** a reviewed batch, **When** the user confirms it, **Then** the included rows enter the
   ledger with the categories shown in review, rows the user left untouched in "Uncategorised",
   and balances update.
10. **Given** a pending batch, **When** the user discards it, **Then** nothing enters the ledger.
11. **Given** a file in which some rows cannot be parsed (unreadable date, missing amount), **When**
    the batch is reviewed, **Then** those rows are not among the rows under review, a count of
    unparsable rows is shown, selecting the count presents them with the reason each failed, they
    cannot be confirmed, and the rest of the batch remains reviewable.
12. **Given** the user closes the app with a batch pending, **When** they return, **Then** the batch
    is still pending and reviewable.

---

### User Story 3 - See where the money went over a chosen period (Priority: P3)

The user opens Insights, picks a time period, and sees spending over time, the proportion of
spending by expense category, and the proportion of income by income category. Unaccounted money is
visible as a known unknown, never hidden.

**Why this priority**: The charts are the product's purpose; the ledger and import exist to make
them trustworthy. Ranked after import because charts over a hand-entered trickle are of little use.

**Independent Test**: With a few months of transactions in the ledger, select several periods and
verify that every chart reflects exactly the transactions in the period, excluding transfers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** transactions across several months, **When** the user selects a period, **Then** the
   spending-over-time line, expense breakdown, and income breakdown include only transactions dated
   within the period.
2. **Given** transfers exist in the period, **Then** no chart or total includes them.
3. **Given** a reconciliation shortfall in the period, **Then** expense "Unaccounted" appears in the
   expense breakdown, visually distinguished from ordinary categories, with its true share.
4. **Given** a reconciliation surplus in the period, **Then** income "Unaccounted" appears in the
   income breakdown; this is the only place a surplus is surfaced.
5. **Given** transactions in "Uncategorised", **Then** they appear in their side's breakdown as their
   own slice, so the user can see how much sorting remains.
6. **Given** a period with no transactions, **Then** the view shows an empty state, not an error.
7. **Given** the user opens Insights, **Then** the period defaults to the current calendar month.

---

### User Story 4 - Plan spending with monthly budgets (Priority: P4)

The user sets a monthly spending limit on an expense category. Insights shows, per budgeted
category, how much of the limit has been spent in the period, with a clear over-limit state. Each
calendar month starts fresh.

**Why this priority**: This is what turns a ledger into an assistant: it tells the user whether they
spent more than they intended. It needs the ledger, categories, and the Insights view to exist.

**Independent Test**: Set a limit on one category, record expenses in it across two months, and
verify progress for each month against the limit, including the over-limit state and the reset at
month start.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** expense category "Groceries", **When** the user sets a monthly limit of 400.00, **Then**
   Insights for the current month shows Groceries spent against 400.00.
2. **Given** Groceries spending of 430.00 in the month, **Then** the Groceries bar is in a clearly
   distinguishable over-limit state.
3. **Given** 250.00 unspent in September, **When** October begins, **Then** October's Groceries
   progress starts at 0.00 against 400.00; nothing rolls over.
4. **Given** an income category, or "Uncategorised", or "Unaccounted", **When** the user looks for a
   way to set a budget on it, **Then** none is offered.
5. **Given** a budgeted category, **When** the user changes or removes the limit, **Then** progress
   reflects the change immediately.
6. **Given** the Insights period is July to September, **Then** budget progress shows September
   only, labelled with that month.

<a id="user-story-5"></a>
### User Story 5 - Reconcile an account to reality (Priority: P5)

The user states what an account actually holds right now. The app books the difference between the
computed balance and the stated balance to "Unaccounted", so the computed balance is honest again.

**Why this priority**: Computed balances drift from reality, especially for cash. Reconciliation is
what keeps them trustworthy without letting the user edit a balance directly. It depends on the
ledger and on the protected categories.

**Independent Test**: With a known computed balance, reconcile to a lower and then a higher amount
and verify the transactions created and the resulting balance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** "Cash" has a computed balance of 100.00, **When** the user reconciles it to 85.00,
   **Then** an expense of 15.00 in expense "Unaccounted" is booked to "Cash" dated today, and "Cash"
   shows 85.00.
2. **Given** "Cash" has a computed balance of 100.00, **When** the user reconciles it to 120.00,
   **Then** an income of 20.00 in income "Unaccounted" is booked to "Cash" dated today, and "Cash"
   shows 120.00.
3. **Given** computed and stated balances are equal, **When** the user reconciles, **Then** no
   transaction is created and the user is told the account already matches.
4. **Given** any account of any type, **Then** reconciliation is available; it is not a cash-only
   operation.

---

### User Story 6 - Organise categories (Priority: P6)

The user adjusts the predefined expense and income categories: creates, renames, recolours, and
deletes them. The two protected categories on each side can be renamed and recoloured but never
deleted.

**Why this priority**: The predefined sets make the app useful on first launch, so category
management is needed later than the ledger, import, and charts it feeds.

**Independent Test**: Rename, recolour, create, and delete categories on both sides, including an
attempt to delete a protected one, and verify transactions and budgets respond as specified.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** first launch, **Then** both the expense set and the income set contain a predefined
   list of categories, each including "Uncategorised" and "Unaccounted".
2. **Given** an expense category "Eating out", **When** the user renames it to "Restaurants" and
   changes its colour, **Then** all its transactions and its budget show the new name and colour.
3. **Given** "Restaurants" has 12 transactions and a budget, **When** the user deletes it, **Then**
   the 12 transactions move to expense "Uncategorised" and the budget is removed.
4. **Given** "Uncategorised" or "Unaccounted" on either side, **When** the user tries to delete it,
   **Then** the app refuses and explains why; renaming and recolouring succeed.
5. **Given** an expense category named "Refunds" exists, **When** the user creates an income
   category named "Refunds", **Then** it succeeds; **When** they create a second expense category
   named "Refunds", **Then** the app refuses and explains why.

---

### Edge Cases

- The user imports history older than the transactions the opening balance was set against: the
  balance double-counts those rows until the user lowers the opening balance to match. The app
  cannot detect this, which is why changing the opening balance is warned about, not blocked.
- A transfer's other leg appears when the counter-account's export is imported later. A pending row
  whose account is the counter-account of an existing transfer, with the same date and amount, is
  flagged as a duplicate like any other.
- The same file is imported twice: every row is flagged as a duplicate and confirming with defaults
  adds nothing.
- A batch contains two rows with the same date and amount: the second is flagged as a duplicate of
  the first within the batch, because banks do emit genuine identical rows on the same day, and
  the user can include it.
- An import file has a header only, or no rows: the user is told the file contained no transactions
  and no batch is created.
- The Insights period spans more than one calendar month: budget progress is shown for the most
  recent calendar month in the period only, labelled with that month.
- A transaction's kind is changed after it was saved: the category or destination account follows
  the same rule as during entry ([FR-015](#fr-015)); nothing is left empty.
- A transaction is moved to a different account: both accounts' balances update.
- The amount field does not accept a negative value; the kind carries the direction. A zero amount
  is allowed ([FR-010](#fr-010)).
- Two accounts, two mapping profiles, or two categories on the same side with the same name are
  refused.
- A very large expense "Unaccounted" share appears in Insights: it is shown at its true size; there
  is no option to hide or merge it.
- The browser window is narrow: every flow in this spec is completable at small window size without
  horizontal scrolling.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Accounts**

- **FR-001**: Users MUST be able to create and edit an account with a name, a type, and an opening
  balance: what the account held before its earliest recorded transaction. Changing the opening
  balance MUST require the user to confirm a severe warning that every computed balance of the
  account will change.
- **FR-002**: System MUST compute each account's balance as its opening balance plus the net effect
  of its transactions. A balance MUST NOT be stored or edited as a number of its own; stating an
  account's actual balance is done through reconciliation ([FR-005](#fr-005)), which books the
  difference as a transaction.
- <a id="fr-004"></a>**FR-004**: System MUST give no account type special behaviour; the type is descriptive only, and
  a cash account is an ordinary account.
- <a id="fr-005"></a>**FR-005**: Users MUST be able to reconcile any account by stating its actual balance. System MUST
  book the difference as a single transaction dated the day of reconciliation: an expense of the category "Unaccounted" when the stated balance is lower than the computed one, an income of the category
  "Unaccounted" when it is higher, and no transaction when they are equal.
- <a id="fr-006"></a>**FR-006**: On first launch, system MUST create one account named "Cash", of
  type cash, with an opening balance of 0.00. It is an ordinary account ([FR-004](#fr-004)),
  editable like any other, and it is the default account for manual entry. Once it gets deleted,
  the default is the account most recently used for manual entry; since accounts cannot be deleted
  in v1 ([Out of Scope](#out-of-scope)), this fallback is not reachable in v1.

**Transactions**

- <a id="fr-010"></a>**FR-010**: Every transaction MUST have a date, an amount of zero or more, an account, and a
  kind: expense, income, or transfer. A description is optional.
- **FR-011**: An expense MUST carry exactly one expense category and an income exactly one income
  category; the form MUST never offer a state without one, holding the side's "Uncategorised"
  until the user picks another. A transfer MUST carry no category and MUST name a second,
  different account of the user's as its destination; the form MUST offer a destination account in
  place of the category and MUST NOT offer the source account as destination.
- **FR-012**: System MUST exclude transfers from every spending figure, income figure, and budget.
- **FR-013**: Users MUST be able to create, edit, and delete transactions manually.
- **FR-014**: The manual-entry form MUST open with kind expense, date today, amount 0.00, account
  the default account ([FR-006](#fr-006)), category expense "Uncategorised", and an empty
  description, and MUST be saveable without any change; recording a typical cash expense means
  editing only the amount and the category.
- <a id="fr-015"></a>**FR-015**: A transaction MUST never hold a category from the other side. When the kind changes
  between expense and income, the category MUST become the new side's "Uncategorised"; when it
  changes to transfer, the category MUST be removed and a destination account required; when it
  changes from transfer, the destination MUST be removed and the category MUST become the new
  side's "Uncategorised".

**CSV import**

- **FR-020**: Users MUST be able to import transactions from a CSV file into a chosen account.
- **FR-021**: Users MUST be able to define, name, save, and reuse a mapping profile that records:
  which columns hold the date, the amount (one signed column, or separate debit and credit
  columns), the description, and optionally the counterparty; the date format; the decimal
  separator; and the file encoding.
- **FR-022**: System MUST place parsed rows in a pending batch that has no effect on balances,
  figures, or budgets until confirmed. Pending batches MUST survive closing and reopening the app.
- **FR-023**: System MUST propose the kind of each row from the direction of its amount (money out
  is an expense, money in is an income) and MUST let the user change any row to a transfer with a
  counter-account during review.
- **FR-024**: System MUST flag a pending row as a duplicate when it matches, on account, date, and
  amount, either an existing ledger transaction or an earlier row in the same batch, whether or
  not the descriptions match; and when its account is the counter-account of an existing transfer
  with the same date and amount.
- **FR-025**: Flagged rows MUST be excluded from confirmation by default and MUST NOT appear among
  the rows under review. Review MUST show how many rows are flagged; selecting that number MUST
  present them, and the user MUST be able to include any individual one.
- <a id="fr-026"></a>**FR-026**: Review MUST group pending rows by vendor where possible. The vendor
  is the counterparty column when the profile maps one, otherwise transactions are presented
  ungrouped. Also, if a group contains only one transaction, it is not grouped. Assigning a
  category to a group MUST assign it to every row in the group. The user MUST be able to unfold a
  group and assign categories per row.
- **FR-027**: Confirming a batch MUST move its included rows into the ledger with the categories
  shown in review. Discarding a batch MUST leave the ledger unchanged.
- **FR-028**: Rows the profile cannot parse MUST NOT appear among the rows under review and MUST
  NOT be confirmable. Review MUST show how many there are; selecting that number MUST present them
  with the reason each failed. The remaining rows MUST stay reviewable.
- <a id="fr-029"></a>**FR-029**: Every row under review MUST hold a category, initially its side's
  "Uncategorised"; the category dropdown MUST offer no empty state, so no row can be confirmed
  without a category.

**Categories**

- **FR-030**: System MUST keep expense categories and income categories as two separate sets. A
  category picker MUST show only the set matching the transaction's kind, and the two sets MUST
  never appear in one list.
- <a id="fr-031"></a>**FR-031**: On first launch, both sets MUST contain a predefined list of categories, each set
  including the protected categories "Uncategorised" and "Unaccounted".
- **FR-032**: Users MUST be able to create, rename, recolour, and delete categories. Names MUST be
  unique within a set; the same name MAY exist on both sides.
- **FR-033**: System MUST refuse deletion of "Uncategorised" and "Unaccounted" on either side, while
  allowing them to be renamed and recoloured.
- **FR-034**: Deleting a category MUST move its transactions to "Uncategorised" on the same side and
  MUST remove any budget attached to it.
- <a id="fr-035"></a>**FR-035**: System MUST itself assign "Uncategorised" to imported rows the
  user did not recategorise ([FR-029](#fr-029)) and to transactions whose category is deleted, and
  "Unaccounted" to reconciliation differences.

**Budgets**

- **FR-040**: Users MUST be able to set, change, and remove a monthly spending limit on any expense
  category other than "Uncategorised" and "Unaccounted". Income categories MUST NOT carry budgets.
- **FR-041**: Budget progress MUST compare the expenses in a category within a calendar month against
  that month's limit. Each calendar month MUST start at zero; unspent amounts MUST NOT roll over.
- **FR-042**: A category whose spending exceeds its limit MUST be shown in a state clearly
  distinguishable from one within its limit.

**Insights**

- <a id="fr-050"></a>**FR-050**: Users MUST be able to select a time period by start and end date,
  with presets for common periods (see [Assumptions](#assumptions)), defaulting to the current
  calendar month.
- **FR-051**: Insights MUST show, for the selected period: spending over time as a line; the
  proportion of spending by expense category; the proportion of income by income category; and
  budget progress per budgeted expense category for the most recent calendar month in the period.
- **FR-052**: "Unaccounted" MUST appear in its side's breakdown at its true share, visually
  distinguished as a known unknown, and MUST NOT be hidden or merged.
- **FR-053**: Charts MUST be read-only in v1.

**Whole application**

- <a id="fr-060"></a>**FR-060**: Every flow in this spec MUST be completable in a browser at small
  window size without horizontal scrolling (quantified in [SC-007](#sc-007)).
- **FR-061**: The application MUST NOT send any user data or usage information to any external
  party, and MUST NOT require a network connection for any v1 capability.
- **FR-062**: The application MUST NOT initiate, schedule, or instruct any movement of real money.
- **FR-063**: The application MUST open on the transaction list. Accounts are deliberately
  low-prominence: they exist to make the numbers trustworthy and are not the app's home.

### Key Entities

- **Account**: Something the user holds money in. Has a name, a descriptive type, an opening
  balance, and a computed balance. Cash is an ordinary account; one is predefined and is
  the default for manual entry ([FR-006](#fr-006)).
- **Transaction**: One movement of money. Has a date, an amount of zero or more, an optional
  description, a kind (expense, income, transfer), and an account. An expense or income has one
  category from its side. A transfer has a destination account instead of a category.
- **Category**: A label for expenses or incomes. Has a name, a colour, a side (expense or income),
  and whether it is protected. Each side has the protected "Uncategorised" (a to-do) and
  "Unaccounted" (a final answer).
- **Budget**: A monthly spending limit attached to one non-protected expense category.
- **Mapping profile**: A named, reusable description of one bank's CSV layout: column roles, date
  format, decimal separator, encoding.
- **Pending batch**: The result of one import, held outside the ledger until confirmed or
  discarded. Belongs to one account and one profile.
- **Pending row**: One parsed line in a pending batch: its parsed fields, its vendor group, its
  proposed kind, its category or counter-account, whether it is flagged as a duplicate, whether it
  failed to parse, and whether it is included in confirmation.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- <a id="sc-001"></a>**SC-001**: A user with a saved mapping profile that maps a counterparty column
  imports and fully reviews one month of bank activity (about 300 rows across about 40 vendors) in
  under 5 minutes, ending with zero rows in "Uncategorised" on that side.
- **SC-002**: A user records a categorised cash expense in under 15 seconds from opening the entry
  form.
- **SC-003**: Re-importing a file that overlaps an already-confirmed range and accepting the review
  defaults adds zero transactions to the ledger.
- **SC-004**: Recording any transfer leaves every spending total, income total, and budget progress
  figure unchanged.
- **SC-005**: At every moment, every displayed account balance equals the account's opening balance
  plus the net of its transactions, recomputed independently from the transaction list.
- **SC-006**: A new user records their first categorised expense within 2 minutes of first opening
  the app, without creating any account or category.
- <a id="sc-007"></a>**SC-007**: Every flow in this spec is completable in a browser window 360 pixels wide without
  horizontal scrolling.
- **SC-008**: During any flow in this spec, the application makes no connection to any destination
  other than the user's own machine.
- **SC-009**: Insights for a period containing 5,000 transactions renders within 2 seconds of
  choosing the period.
- **SC-010**: A 5,000-row CSV parses into a reviewable pending batch within 10 seconds.
- **SC-011**: Over-limit budget categories are identifiable in Insights without reading any number.

## Out of Scope

Listed so that "should we add…?" has an answer that does not require a meeting.

**Never** — these would change what the product is:

- Moving money. The app is a read-only ledger; it never initiates a payment.
- Bank APIs, Open Banking, credential storage, or screen scraping. CSV is the boundary, which keeps
  the app free of credentials, licensing regimes, and per-bank integration maintenance.
- Telemetry or analytics of any kind, opt-in or otherwise.

**Not in v1** — defensible later, deliberately excluded now:

- Multi-currency support.
- Archiving or deleting accounts. An unused account stays in the list; revisit if dead accounts
  actually accumulate.
- Linking an income category to an expense category so a refund offsets the category it came from.
- Investment, asset, or net-worth tracking.
- Tax reporting or accounting-standard exports.
- Native mobile applications. Usable in a browser at a small window size is the whole v1 mobile
  commitment ([FR-060](#fr-060)).
- Recurring-transaction detection and forecasting.
- Budget rollover, and budget periods other than monthly. Both are wanted later and will be
  user-selectable when they arrive.
- Rule-based auto-categorisation on import; it collides with KISS as a product rule.
- Vendor grouping for files without a counterparty column, by truncating the description at its
  first digit (punctuation removed, whitespace collapsed, ignoring case). Fine for a later version;
  v1 groups only by a mapped counterparty column ([FR-026](#fr-026)).
- Learned recall: pre-filling a vendor's category from the user's own past decisions, with nothing
  to author. The first thing to add once import is proven.
- AI features, deferred by design rather than rejected: receipt scanning into a transaction,
  analysis with recommendations, and transaction pre-categorisation on import (local-only,
  suggestion-only, user-invoked, and needed only if learned recall proves insufficient). The ledger
  must be provably trustworthy before anything probabilistic sits on top of it. The name Financial
  Copilot anticipates these features.
- Docker images and desktop packaging. v1 is a local web app; these are later delivery options and
  v1 must not foreclose them.
- Drill-down from a chart into its transactions. Desirable, to be considered in UX design, not a v1
  commitment.
